AI-powered News Article Generation with Interactive Chat Interface
This repository showcases a project that leverages powerful language models (LLMs) to automate parts of the news article generation process. It features an interactive chat interface where two AI agents play the roles of editors, collaborating to create a concise and engaging summary of a given topic.

**_Key Features_**:

- **GPT-3.5**: Utilizes the capabilities of GPT-3.5, a versatile LLM capable of text generation, summarization, and more.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Engage in a simulated conversation with two AI editors who refine and polish the article summary.**
- Image Recognition**: Identify potential places for image insertion within the summary, providing DALLE-compatible prompts for creation.
- **Customization**: The topic and initial prompt can be easily changed, allowing for exploration of various scenarios.
- **Open-Source**: Contribute to the project's development and explore its potential for news generation automation.
