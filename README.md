- AI-powered News Article Generation with Interactive Chat Interface (TBD)
- This repository showcases a project that leverages powerful language models (LLMs) to automate parts of the news article generation process. 
- It features two AI agents play the roles of editors, collaborating to create a concise and engaging summary of a given topic.

**_Key Features_**:

- **GPT-3.5**: Utilizes the capabilities of GPT-3.5, a versatile LLM capable of text generation, summarization, and more.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Engage in a simulated conversation with two AI editors who refine and polish the article summary.**
- Image Recognition**: Identify potential places for image insertion within the summary, providing DALLE-compatible prompts for creation.
- **Customization**: The topic and initial prompt can be easily changed, allowing for exploration of various scenarios.
- **Open-Source**: Contribute to the project's development and explore its potential for news generation automation.




**_Getting Started_**:

- **Clone the repository**: git clone https://github.com/Mehul-Gupta-SMH/Article-Generation-Pipeline.git
- **Install dependencies**: Refer to the requirements.txt file for instructions.
- **Set API keys**: Replace the placeholder '' with your OpenAI API key in the config_list variable.
- **Run the script**: Execute python Summary.py to start the interactive chat interface.




**_Interactive Demo_**:

_Type in a topic or prompt and observe how the AI editors collaborate to craft a polished summary_.

- **Emp_Editor**: Generates the initial summary, suggesting image placeholders where relevant.
